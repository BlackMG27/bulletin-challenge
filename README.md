## My Process 

1. I experimented with the both APIs to see what I was dealing with. 
2. I set up my React file structure to my liking 
3. Played with various functions that would allow me to get:
   1. Current 
      - current temp 
      - figured out the date 
      - feels like temp
      - location (city, country)
      - high and low temps
      - weather description and weather icon via react-weather-icons
    2. Forecast
        - the date by grouping the list array by `dt_txt.substring(0,10)` 
        - the highs and lows 
        - whether or not it would rain that day
4. Built out the search bar 
5. Built out the results section dividing the current and forecast section as aside and main 
6. used flexbox for the design along with SCSS
